  ​              <p>A short review by JM:</p>
                <p>"Alright! Bloody delicious. The vineyards are somewhere between Bendigo and Heathcote in Victoria.
                  The wine is made by a guy named Jake Winther. 100% whole-bunch, minimal fining, filtration, or additions aside from a little sulphur before bottling.
                  It poured a little cloudy. Quite a bit of fine sediment in the bottle and a little bit of dissolved CO2. Nice perfume to start but due to sediment I decanted and let it sit for half an hour and after that it opened up massively.
                  N: White pepper, lavender, plum skins, blue fruits, crushed rock minerality, dried rosemary. On the nose alone, I would've picked this as good quality Northern Rhône.
                  P: Fleshy, supple, though maybe a little disjointed. More dried herbs, wonderful earthy, almost saline character, black olive. Really delicious, just not what I have come to expect structurally from Mourvèdre.
                  For $28AUD, this represents superb value in my books. Best drunk in the next couple of years. The dried herb characters are amazingly reminiscent of the garrigue characters seen in Languedoc wines.
